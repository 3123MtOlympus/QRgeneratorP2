## API Usage

This web application utilizes the [QR Server API](https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=) to generate QR codes. The JavaScript code in the `script.js` file makes HTTP requests to this API to create QR codes based on the data you provide.

You can customize the API URL in the JavaScript code if you want to use a different QR code generation service or modify the parameters.

```javascript
// Modify this URL to use a different QR code generation service if needed
const qrCodeApiUrl = "https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=";
